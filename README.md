# mirror
Mirror a website

This is a wrapper for wget with a bunch of flags meant to mirror a
website.

## Usage

```
mirror SITE_TO_MIRROR
```

## Install

Trust me?

```
curl -sL https://git.io/mirrorinstall | bash
```

Or, use the Makefile:

```
git clone https://github.com/joshuacox/mirror.git
cd mirror
sudo make install
```

Or, just copy to somewhere in your path:

```
git clone https://github.com/joshuacox/mirror.git
cd mirror
sudo cp mirror /usr/local/bin/
```

All three of these methods are functionally equivalent.
